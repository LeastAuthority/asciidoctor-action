= GitHub Asciidoctor Action

This action runs asciidoctor as requested, and includes mermaid and
asciidoctor-diagram for diagram handling.

== Inputs

`files` (**required**)::
    A set of files to parse. This can include globs like `*.adoc`, as well as
    multiglobs like `**/*.adoc`.

`format`::
    Optional, can be set to `pdf` to use `asciidoctor-pdf`. If set to anything
    other than `pdf`, currently the action just runs `asciidoctor` with no
    other changes.
 
`asciidoctor-args`::
    Optional, can be set to additional arguments that should be passed to the
    `asciidoctor` or `asciidoctor-pdf` commands.


== Outputs

`asciidoctor-artifacts`::
    A space-separated list of fully-resolved paths to artifacts generated by
    the asciidoc compile.

== Example Usage

```
uses: thesis/asciidoctor-action@v1
with:
  files: *.adoc **/*.adoc
```
